Step-by-Step Plan for Tic-Tac-Toe
1. Organize the Game's Key Components:
Gameboard: This is where you’ll store the state of the game. You’ll need an array to represent a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the grid will either be empty or contain an 'X' or 'O'. The gameboard will track what happens in the game.

Players: Players will each have a marker (either 'X' or 'O') and a name. There will be two players, and you will need to alternate turns between them.

Game Flow: The game needs to alternate turns, check for a winner, check for a tie, and allow players to take turns. You’ll need a controller that manages how the game progresses.

2. What Goes Where?
Think about the roles of each object:

Gameboard Object:

This will hold the state of the game.
It should handle the board setup (3x3 grid) and resetting the board when needed.
Player Object:

Each player will be an object with a name and a marker.
The Player object will store each player’s unique marker ('X' or 'O').
Game Flow Object:

The Game object is responsible for managing the turn-taking.
It will also check if someone wins or if the game ends in a tie.
3. Plan the Game's Logic:
Turn-based System:

Players will take turns making moves.
After each move, check if the current player has won. If not, move on to the next player.
Check for a Winner:

You’ll check all possible winning combinations on the board (rows, columns, diagonals).
If a player has a complete line, they win.
Check for a Tie:

If the board is full and there’s no winner, it’s a tie.
4. Displaying the Game (When Ready to Use the DOM):
Once you have the game logic down in the console, you can move on to:

Rendering the Board: This is where you’ll make the board visible on the webpage, so players can see the game state.

Handling Player Interaction: You'll need to listen for clicks on the board and place the player's marker in the appropriate spot.

Game Results: After each game, display who won or if it was a tie. Include an option to restart the game.

5. Keep it Simple and Tidy:
Keep the logic inside objects/factories to ensure that each part of the game is responsible for one thing and one thing only.
Avoid using too many global variables; try to structure everything in objects (like the Gameboard, Player, and Game).
Now, Focus on These:
Think about the gameboard: How will the state of the board look at the beginning of the game? What happens after each move?
Understand how players interact with the game: What happens when a player takes a turn? How does the game switch to the other player?
Game flow management: How will the game check for a winner or tie? What needs to happen to end the game?
